/-! Utilities for handling "equational definitions". An equational definition is an equation
of the form `∀ x₁ ⋯ xₙ, c x₁ ⋯ xₙ = body[x₁,⋯,xₙ]` in the local context, where `c` is either
a global constant or a local variable. The LHS should be fully applied so that the equality
is not at a universally quantified (aka function) type.

These usually start off as copied equational theorems of global constants but are then transformed
to an SMT-compatible form.

Note that equational definitions have an advantage over let-bindings in that we do not need
to justify the termination of `body`. This does however imply that rewriting by an equational
definition may never reach a fixpoint.

## Representation

The equational definition for `foo` is stored as `foo.def` in the local context.

TODO(WN): We could have a custom `smt` tactic mode which provides explicit storage for eqn-defs
and displays them more nicely. -/

    /- Consider the curried definition
    ```lean
    def baw (a : Int) : Int → Int := Int.add a
    ```
    For this, Lean generates the equational theorem
    ```lean
    ∀ (a : Int), baw a = Int.add a
    ```
    which is transformed by the first `forallTelescope` into `baw a = Int.add a`, an equality
    at a function type. Since we want equational definitions to be fully applied, we need to apply
    a second `forallTelescope` on the type of this equality in order to get `baw a b = Int.add a b`,
    which then gets abstracted into `∀ (a b : Int), baw a b = Int.add a b`. -/
